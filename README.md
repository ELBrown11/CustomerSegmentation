# Customer Segmentation to Targeted Marketing for Arvato Financial

## Project Overview
The main goal is to determine the most efficient way to acquire new clientele. To achieve this, we apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze a demographic dataset of German customers from a mail-order company alongside data from the general German population. By identifying patterns and characteristics of individuals most likely to become new customers, businesses can execute targeted marketing strategies, improving customer acquisition efficiency. This data-driven approach allows companies to move beyond intuition or prior knowledge, optimizing their marketing efforts with actionable insights.

### 2 main steps of the project:
1. **Customer segmentation report:** created by using an unsupervised learning model to analyze the attributes of established customers and the general population
2. **supervised learning model:** use a 3rd dataset which contains attributes of customers who were targeted for marketing of the mail-order company. prior analysis will be used to predict whether or not those sent marketing will respond
